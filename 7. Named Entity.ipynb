       " 'But even tough debates can be conducted in a civil tone, and our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger.',\n",
       " 'To confront the great issues before us, we must act in a spirit of goodwill and respect for one another -- and I will do my part.',\n",
       " 'Tonight the state of our Union is strong -- and together we will make it stronger.',\n",
